    <div class="primeira-div">In my early 20s, before I became a walking, moaning diabetes risk, I used to think the lamest thing in all of creation was grown-ass people picking up a new hobby via the medium of adult learning courses. What, you want to learn stuff? In your spare time? Neerrrrrrrrrrd.</div>
    <div class="segunda-div">But now I get it: I haven't learned anything new in a really long time, and it's fun to learn something on your own terms, without being lectured to from a podium. And here's another thing I do with every second of my fucking day: look at a screen. So hell yeah I want to learn to, like, climb rocks, or keep butterflies, or play badminton. As long as I am looking at Twitter one less hour of my life, then maybe I will have a shot at being happy.</div>
    <p class="paragrafo">Maybe you have actually birthed a human child out of your body or that of another. If so, congratulations on having to be responsible for every remaining second of your life until you die. If not, just find the nearest younger cousin or kid nephew or something like that and be the absolute coolest uncle or auntie you can be.</p>
